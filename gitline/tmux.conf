# Tmux Configuration for Windows

Welcome to my Tmux configuration repository for Windows! This repository contains my personal Tmux configuration setup along with detailed instructions on how to set it up on your Windows machine.

## Introduction

Tmux is a powerful terminal multiplexer that allows you to create and manage multiple terminal sessions within a single window. It's particularly useful for managing complex development environments and working with multiple command-line applications simultaneously.

## Features

- Customized key bindings for easy navigation.
- Enhanced status bar to display session information, window list, and system time.
- Mouse support for interactive session management.
- Clean and minimalistic configuration for improved productivity.

## Installation

To get started with Tmux on Windows, follow these simple steps:

1. **Install Tmux**:
   - If you haven't already installed Tmux, you can do so by using a package manager like Cygwin, Git Bash, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). For example, you can install Tmux using Git Bash by running:
     ```bash
     pacman -S tmux
     ```

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone this repository to your preferred location on your Windows machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tmux-config.git ~/.tmux-config
     ```

3. **Symlink the Configuration File**:
   - Create a symbolic link for the `.tmux.conf` file in your home directory:
     ```bash
     ln -s ~/.tmux-config/.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
     ```

4. **Start Tmux**:
   - Start Tmux by running the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     tmux
     ```

## Usage

Once Tmux is installed and the configuration file is symlinked, you can start using Tmux right away. Here are some basic commands to get you started:

- **Create a New Session**: Press `Ctrl + b`, then `c`.
- **Switch between Sessions**: Press `Ctrl + b`, then `(` or `)`.
- **Split Panes Vertically**: Press `Ctrl + b`, then `%`.
- **Split Panes Horizontally**: Press `Ctrl + b`, then `"`.

For more commands and customization options, refer to the Tmux documentation and the `.tmux.conf` file in this repository.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the `.tmux.conf` file according to your preferences. You can modify key bindings, status bar settings, colors, and more to suit your workflow.

## Contributions

If you have any suggestions, improvements, or bug fixes for this Tmux configuration, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions are always welcome!
